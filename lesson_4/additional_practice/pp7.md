1. Understand the problem
  - Given a string, create a hash with the keys as letters in the string
      and values are frequency which each letter occurs

2. Set up your test cases
statement = "The Flintstones Rock"
{ "F"=>1, "R"=>1, "T"=>1, "c"=>1, "e"=>2, ... }

3. Describe your inputs, outputs, and databases
- Input: string
- Output: Hash

4. Describe your algorithm
  - Select each letter individually into an array
  - Find the occurences of each letter
  - Add each 

5. Begin coding
